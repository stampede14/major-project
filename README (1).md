# CNN Detection of Wheezes and Crackles
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The notebook demonstrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approach to classify respiratory soundsâ€”specifically identifying **wheezes**, **crackles**, **both**, or **none**â€”from audio recordings.
The dataset used is the **ICBHI 2017 Respiratory Sound Database**, which contains real patient recordings labeled by medical experts.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Convert respiratory audio signals into visual representations (Mel-spectrograms)
- Build a CNN model to classify respiratory conditions
- Evaluate performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification metrics

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- Data preprocessing including segmentation and spectrogram generation
- Deep learning model using CNN (Keras/TensorFlow)
- Visualization of predictions and performance metrics
- Potential for deployment in assistive diagnostic tools
